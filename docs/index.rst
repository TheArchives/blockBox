blockBox |release| Documentation
=================================

Version: |release|

blockBox is a multi-platform server software for the online game Minecraft. It was created in the August 2010, and is currently being maintained by PixelEater. It is in early release stages, and is planned to be released somewhere in October 2010.

blockBox, being written in Python, is very versatile, and with more and more updates to the plugin system, you may never even have to make one modification to the core of the server. Programmers should check out the :ref:`development` guide for information on how to start programming for blockBox.

If you would like to get started and create your very own blockBox server, check out the tutorial!
