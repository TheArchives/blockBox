Getting a Copy
--------------
There are multiple ways to get a copy of blockBox. It all depends on if you would like the
latest and greatest features (which may be unstable), or if you would like a stable release.
Luckily, we have made both ways easy to get. You can always get the latest releases by going to the following links:

Latest Development Release (zip_ | tar.gz_)

Latest Stable Release (Download_)

These links are dynamic and will always work when downloading their specific releases. For more advanced users that plan on extending blockBox, git is also available. Our repository can be found here_.

In order to install blockBox, just extract it to a directory of your choice. Nothing else is required (besides `Python 2.6`_). However, if you downloaded the nolib version, there is more work to do. A guide will be formed on that later.
