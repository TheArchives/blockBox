Worlds are stored in this directory.
Each world has 2 definitive contents - world.meta and blocks.gz.
Other contents may include a backup folder which is used for storing backups, if that particular system is enabled.
It is highly recommended not to replace files in here while the world is online -- if you must, please shut down the world first.
The .trash directory is used to store deleted worlds using ingame commands.
It is safe to delete those worlds.
