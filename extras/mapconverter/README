HOW TO USE
BOTH WINDOWS AND LINUX
Please remember to put minecraft-server.jar in the same directory of this folder!

WINDOWS
Make sure you have the Sun JRE installed, double click convert.bat.

LINUX
Make sure you have the Sun JRE installed, run the following codes IN ORDER:
java -Xms512M -Xmx512M -cp minecraft-server.jar; OrigFormat load map.dat map
java -Xms512M -Xmx512M -cp minecraft-server.jar; OrigFormat save map.dat map

After running the commands a folder with the world name would appear. Copy it into mapdata/worlds and load into the world. Ta-da! Your world is now online.
If the world is already running (or is default map) please shut down the world (/shutdown worldname, for default please shut down server) or else the world will break!
