dat2persist is a handy tool for converting iCraft's .dat files to blockBox's persist format.

HOWTOUSE:
1. Put lastseen.meta, balances.dat and ranks.dat into the same directory as the dat2persist.exe.
2. Run dat2persist.exe
3. ???
4. PROFIT, now put the generated persist folder into the root directory of your blockBox installation, replacing the current persist folder.
